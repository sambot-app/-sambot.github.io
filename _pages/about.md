# About Jay & Jay

## Hello world !

**Sambot app** has been designed and developed by **Jay & Jay**, a french company based in Paris and founded by JÃ©rÃ©mie Godon & Jeffrey Macko, two iOS developers. These friends enjoy working on this Apple platform since SDK 3.0 (let's say most of the time... except when new Xcode beta breaks things)...

## Ambitions

Jay & Jay goal is to **develop modern mobile applications** by themselves, mixing their time between production of smart code on modern stacks with a sustainable work-life balance so they can spend enough time with their friends, hobbies or families.

Quality of code, user privacy and native platform elements are three essential axes of Jay & Jay development philosophy that aren't really open to negociation except if you have great arguments.

## Contact

If you have any questions, expectations or feedbacks about Sambot app, feel free to **ask for whatever you would like to see embeded** in future releases (or what you definitively wouldn't)...

Jay & Jay team is always happy to meet people from the developers community (especially if you come from the iOS world ðŸ˜‰) so do not hesitate to contact us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sambot_app) or [by email](mailto:sambot-public1021@jaynjay.app).

See you around !

Jay & Jay
