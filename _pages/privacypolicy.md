# Privacy Policy
**Last updated** November 2, 2021

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Sambot’s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information we collect

New Sambot accounts are created anonymously, without email addresses or passwords.

We store information about your device to send notifications. We also collect anonymous statistics about how you use the app to help to improve it.

## Technical basics

If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing.

Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.

## iCloud

Sambot stores some of your data in Apple’s iCloud service, to enable some sync features between all devices signed in to your Apple ID.

## Analytics

Sambot’s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Sambot’s functionality. --We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as services that host your continuous integration solution.--

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS.

## Accessing, changing, or deleting information

You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Sambot iOS app.

Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.

Sambot may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.

## GDPR

We comply with the GDPR. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.
And don't build identifiable information.

## Information for European Union Customers

By using Sambot and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

## International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may apply to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email [privacy service](mailto:privacy@sambot.app). Please note that account deletion should be done within the Sambot app, not via email requests, for security reasons.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page.
